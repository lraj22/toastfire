# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Toastfire is currently in development, so every "version" is supported. Every security issue will be handled before releasing `v1.0.0`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, fill out and submit a [new security advisory](https://github.com/lraj22/toastfire/security/advisories/new). We take these seriously and will get back to you as soon as possible. We will also keep you updated with any progress.

Thank you for taking your time to report vulnerabilities. It is greatly appreciated.
